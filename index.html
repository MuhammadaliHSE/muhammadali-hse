I specialize in hazard identification, risk assessment, safety audits, and employee training. I collaborate with various departments to maintain high safety standards and implement proactive solutions to reduce risks.</p>
  <p>With certifications in NEBOSH, ISO 45001, and OSHA, I bring deep knowledge of global HSE practices and a passion for continuous improvement. I aim to make every workplace safer, more efficient, and more environmentally responsible.</p>
