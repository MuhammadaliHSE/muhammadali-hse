            <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a highly dedicated and results-driven Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Officer with over five years of experience in ensuring the safety and well-being of employees across Industrial JWDC, Jubail (Jazlah water desalination plant) and construction KAFD, Riyadh (King Abdullah Financial District) projects.
                My commitment to fostering a safe work environment is not just about compliance but also about creating a culture where safety is at the forefront of every operation.
                I specialize in identifying potential hazards, conducting risk assessments, and implementing proactive safety measures to prevent accidents and improve overall organizational efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach to workplace safety is centered around continuous learning and collaboration. By actively engaging with management, employees, and contractors, I ensure that safety policies are not only well-communicated but are also actively followed.
                Whether it's conducting safety audits, delivering training sessions, or participating in incident investigations, I aim to drive a culture where everyone understands the importance of safety and adheres to the highest standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                With certifications in various international safety standards (such as ISO 45001, NEBOSH, and OSHA), I possess a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory frameworks and best practices that govern workplace safety.
                I continuously stay updated with emerging trends in safety management and am always eager to bring innovative solutions to the organizations I serve.
